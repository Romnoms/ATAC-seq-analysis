- **Publication**: PMID 33568479

## Processing Pipeline
1. **QC**: FastQC v0.11.2
2. **Adapter Removal**: TrimGalore v0.4.2 with cutadapt v1.8.1
3. **Alignment**: Bowtie2 v2.3.4.1 to hg19
4. **Duplicate Removal**: Picard v1.89
5. **Peak Calling**: MACS2 v2.1.0

## Key Findings

### 1. Global Chromatin Accessibility Changes
- **G82 (Parental)**: 54,414 peaks
- **G82R (Resistant)**: 60,338 peaks (+10.9%)
- **Peak Overlap**: 73.06% of G82R peaks overlap with G82
- **Unique to G82R**: 16,256 new accessible regions

### 2. Peak Characteristics
| Metric | G82 | G82R | Change |
|--------|-----|------|--------|
| Mean Width (bp) | 344.58 | 359.39 | +4.3% |
| Median Width (bp) | 268 | 272 | +1.5% |
| Mean Enrichment | 17.09 | 19.64 | +14.9% |
| Mean Signal | 139.3 | 165.6 | +18.9% |

### 3. Chromosome-Specific Changes
Most affected chromosomes (by peak count change):
- Chr3: +756 peaks (+22.2%)
- Chr6: +541 peaks (+16.8%)
- Chr11: +379 peaks (+12.9%)
- Chr18: -174 peaks (-15.0%)
- ChrX: +195 peaks (+10.8%)

### 4. Top Enriched Regions (Conserved)
1. chr13:110076381-110076783
2. chr7:45291506-45291790
3. chr6:62283957-62284285
4. chr5:71146661-71147024

## Biological Interpretation

### Acquired Resistance Phenotype
The G82R cells show:
1. **Increased chromatin accessibility** overall
2. **Higher signal intensities** suggesting stronger ATAC-seq signal
3. **Broader peaks** indicating extended accessible regions
4. **Gain of new regulatory regions** (~16,000 unique peaks)

### Potential Mechanisms
1. **Epigenetic reprogramming** during resistance acquisition
2. **Enhanced transcriptional activity** (higher enrichment scores)
3. **Altered regulatory landscape** (new accessible regions)
4. **Chromosome-specific responses** to selection pressure

## Quality Metrics Assessment
Based on ATAC-seq best practices:
- ✓ Peak counts (54-60K) within expected range
- ✓ Peak widths (200-400bp) typical for ATAC-seq
- ✓ High enrichment scores indicating good signal-to-noise
- ✓ Consistent peak calling between related samples

## Recommendations for Further Analysis
1. **Annotate peaks** to genomic features (promoters, enhancers, etc.)
2. **Motif analysis** to identify TF binding changes
3. **Integrate with RNA-seq** if available
4. **Pathway analysis** of genes near differential peaks
5. **Investigate chromosome-specific changes** (especially Chr3, Chr6)
