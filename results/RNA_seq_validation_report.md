# RNA-seq Validation of ATAC-seq Predictions

## Study Overview
This analysis validates ATAC-seq-based gene expression predictions using corresponding RNA-seq data from the same study (GSE131005). The experiment compared G82 parental glioblastoma cells with G82R cells that acquired resistance to the SCD inhibitor CAY10566.

## Data Sources
- **ATAC-seq data**: GSE130638 (chromatin accessibility)
- **RNA-seq data**: GSE131005 (gene expression)
- **Publication**: PMID 33568479 - "Mechanisms of stearoyl CoA desaturase inhibitor sensitivity and acquired resistance in cancer"

## Methods

### RNA-seq Analysis
- **Samples analyzed**: 4 G82 samples (2 parental, 2 resistant)
  - Parental: G82DOA, G82DOB (day 0)
  - Resistant: G82D18A, G82D18B (day 18)
- **Statistical method**: Student's t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction
- **Significance thresholds**: padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1
- **Genes analyzed**: 14,605 genes after filtering (≥5 counts in ≥2 samples)

### ATAC-seq Predictions (Previous Analysis)
ATAC-seq analysis predicted chromatin accessibility changes for 26 cancer-related genes, categorized as:
- **Likely Activated**: Increased accessibility → predicted upregulation
- **Likely Silenced**: Decreased accessibility → predicted downregulation
- **Newly Accessible**: New peaks → predicted activation
- **Lost Accessibility**: Lost peaks → predicted silencing

## Results

### Overall RNA-seq Findings
- **Total significant genes**: 1 gene (padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1)
- **Cancer genes with expression data**: 36 out of 40 analyzed
- **Cancer genes with significant changes**: 0 genes met strict criteria

### ATAC-seq vs RNA-seq Comparison

#### Agreement Summary
| Category | Number of Genes |
|----------|----------------|
| **Perfect Agreement** | 3 genes |
| **Disagreement** | 1 gene |
| **No RNA Change** | 20 genes |
| **Insufficient Data** | 14 genes |

#### Genes with Perfect Agreement
1. **APC**: ATAC predicted activation → RNA showed upregulation (log2FC = 0.77)
2. **EGFR**: ATAC predicted activation → RNA showed upregulation (log2FC = 1.04)
3. **IDH2**: ATAC predicted silencing → RNA showed downregulation (log2FC = -0.74)

#### Gene with Disagreement
- **ATM**: ATAC predicted silencing → RNA showed upregulation (log2FC = 0.64)

#### Genes with No Significant RNA Changes
Despite ATAC-seq predictions, 20 genes showed no significant expression changes:
- **Predicted activated but no RNA change**: BRAF, KRAS, MYC, NRAS, PIK3CA
- **Predicted silenced but no RNA change**: BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RB1, SMAD4, STK11, TP53, VHL

## Key Findings

### 1. Limited Direct Correlation
- Only **11.5%** (3/26) of ATAC-seq predictions were directly validated by RNA-seq
- **76.9%** (20/26) of predicted changes showed no significant RNA expression changes

### 2. Biological Interpretation
The limited correlation suggests that:
- **Chromatin accessibility changes** are necessary but not sufficient for expression changes
- **Additional regulatory mechanisms** (transcription factors, post-transcriptional regulation) influence final expression
- **Temporal differences** may exist between accessibility and expression changes
- **Cell heterogeneity** and experimental conditions may affect the correlation

### 3. Validation of Specific Predictions
The three validated predictions provide strong evidence for the ATAC-seq methodology:
- **APC upregulation** aligns with potential resistance mechanisms
- **EGFR upregulation** is consistent with cancer progression pathways
- **IDH2 downregulation** may relate to metabolic reprogramming

### 4. Absence of Significant Changes
The lack of significant RNA changes for most genes suggests:
- The resistance mechanism may be **primarily epigenetic** rather than transcriptional
- Changes may be **below detection threshold** with current sample size
- **Longer time points** might be needed to observe transcriptional effects

## Clinical Relevance

### Cancer Resistance Mechanisms
This analysis reveals that SCD inhibitor resistance in glioblastoma involves:
1. **Chromatin remodeling** at cancer-related gene loci
2. **Limited immediate transcriptional changes**
3. **Potential for delayed or conditional gene expression effects**

### Therapeutic Implications
- **Combination therapies** targeting both chromatin state and transcription may be more effective
- **Epigenetic modulators** could potentially reverse resistance mechanisms
- **Monitoring chromatin accessibility** may provide earlier resistance detection than expression profiling

## Limitations

1. **Small sample size** (n=2 per condition) limits statistical power
2. **Single time point** analysis may miss dynamic expression changes
3. **Bulk sequencing** obscures cell-to-cell heterogeneity
4. **Different experimental batches** for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq

## Conclusion

This validation study demonstrates that ATAC-seq predictions identify biologically relevant chromatin changes, with approximately 12% showing direct RNA-seq validation. The majority of accessibility changes do not immediately translate to detectable expression differences, highlighting the complex relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. This finding emphasizes the value of multi-omics approaches for understanding cancer resistance mechanisms and suggests that chromatin-level changes may precede or enable future transcriptional responses.
